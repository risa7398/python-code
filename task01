Task
1.Given an integer,n , perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6  to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())
    if n%2!=0:
        print("Weird")
    elif n%2 ==0 and n>2 and n<=5:
        print("Not Weird")
    elif n%2 ==0 and n>6 and n<=20:
        print("Weird")
    else:
        print("Not Weird")




2.The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c=a+b
    print(c)
    c=a-b
    print(c)
    c=a*b
    print(c)

3.The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.
Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a //b . The second line should contain the result of float division, a /b .
No rounding or formatting is necessary.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a//b)
    print(a/b)
